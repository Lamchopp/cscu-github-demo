## Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

Twinkle, twinkle, litle star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.

## Old Town Road - Lil Nas X

I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is atached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Riding on a horse, ha
You can whip ur Porch
I been in the valley
You ain't been up of the porch, now

## Single Ladies - Beyonce

Now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own litle thing
Decided to dip and now you wanna trip
Cause another borther noticed me

## Hello - Adele

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in Calfornia dreaming about who we used to be
When we were yonger and free
I've forgten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
